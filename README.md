## Requirements
**Python version:** Python 3 (tested with 3.6.8)

**Dependencies:** Numpy (tested with version 1.16.2), Pandas (0.23.4), scipy (1.2.1), emcee (2.2.1), numba (0.42.0), matplotlib (2.2.3), seaborn (0.9.0)


## Download

The allelic inclusion inference model can be downloaded using:

```git clone https://github.com/JasonACarter/Allelic_inclusion/Model/Inclusion.py```

## Use 

### Input
Array(s) containing the number of droplets observed to contain *n* unique α and/or β T cell receptor (TCR) sequences. If no experimental distributions are provided, simulated distributions will be generated and used. 

### Output

Maximum *a posteriori* (MAP) estimates and credible intervals for each of the 4 model parameters. 

### Parameters

* **Inference of experimental distributions**
  * **alpha:** Specify array containing experimental α TCR chain distribution to fit (default=None)
  * **beta:** Specify array containing experimental β TCR chain distribution to fit (default=None)
  
* **Inference of simulated distributions**
  * **chains:** If no experimental distributions are specified, should α (alpha), β (beta), or αβ (pairs) distributions be simulated and fit (default=pairs)
  * **la_real:** True loading rate (λ) to use for simulated distributions. As the loading rate refer to T cells, the same rate is used for both α and β distributions. 
  * **ga_real:** True error loading rate (γ) to use for simulated distributions. As the error loading rate refer to T cells, the same rate is used for both α and β distributions. 
  * **f_real_(a)(b):** True allelic inclusion rates to use for simulated αβ distributions
  * **s_real_(a)(b):** True TCR chain dropout rates to use for simulated αβ distributions

* **MCMC parameters** (see [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/))
  * **nwalkers:** Number of [walkers](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/faq/#what-are-walkers)
  * **steps:** MCMC chain length
  * **burn:** Number of steps for burn-in
  * **N_random_starts** Number of random starts to find MAP
  * For these parameters, larger values will provide more accurates estimates at the exspence of run-time
  
 * **Output**  
    * **calculate_posterior:** Whether to calculate posterior distributions (default=1). If 0, will not run MCMC sampling and estimates may therefore not be accurate.  
    * **print_estimates:** Whether to print MAP estimates with credible intervals for each parameter (default=1).
    * **plot_dist:** Whether to plot posterior distributions for each parameter (default=0).
    * **interval:** Specify size of credible interval for print_estimates (default=68).
 
## Example usage 

### Simulated distributions

Infer parameter values from simulated αβ distributions with user-specified parameter values: 
```Python
import Inclusion
Inclusion(chains='pairs', la_real=0.08,ga_real=4.15,f_real_a=0.083,f_real_b=0.043,s_real_a=0.53,s_real_b=0.39)
```
Which should output: 

```
No experimental distributions specified. Running paired simulation. 
Simulated alpha distribution with the following parameters: la:0.08, ga:4.15, f:0.083, s:0.53 
Simulated beta distribution with the following parameters: la:0.08, ga:4.15, f:0.043, s:0.39 

MAP Estimates:
la: 0.537 (0.256,0.856) vs. 0.08
ga: 1.284 (0.234,2.482) vs. 4.15
f_a: 0.537 (0.105,0.829) vs. 0.083
s_a: 0.969 (0.354,0.843) vs. 0.53
f_b: 0.530 (0.178,0.831) vs. 0.043
s_b: 0.544 (0.184,0.740) vs. 0.39
```
Parameter values are given as "MAP (68% credible interval) vs. true value used in simulation."

### Experimental distributions

```Python
counts_alpha=[829988, 812208, 75516, 8203, 1645, 593, 232, 136, 70, 46, 24, 12]
counts_beta=[605727, 1015629, 92206, 11011, 2359, 808, 397, 238, 122, 76, 55, 25]
Inclusion(alpha=counts_alpha,beta=counts_beta)
```

Which should output: 

```
Experimental paired distribution specificed. 

MAP Estimates:
la: 0.077 (0.069,0.093)
ga: 4.144 (4.134,4.155)
f_a: 0.086 (0.079,0.092)
s_a: 0.530 (0.530,0.531)
f_b: 0.042 (0.035,0.048)
s_b: 0.387 (0.386,0.387)
```
Parameter values are again given as "MAP (68% credible interval)", but no true values are unknown for experimental distributions.
